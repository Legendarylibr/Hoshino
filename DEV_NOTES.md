## 🚨 **Current Limitations & Blockers**

## 📱 **Immersive Mode**
**Request**: Hide navigation bar completely for full-screen experience
**Current**: Status bar hidden, nav bar transparent
**Why Not Full**: Requires ejecting from Expo managed workflow, would make managing the project 
more dificult in its current state
**Tried**: `react-native-immersive` - incompatible with Expo managed workflow

## 🎨 **UI Text Underlines**
**Request**: Make underlines under "Yes" and "No" buttons bolder/thicker
**Current**: Using font underline (textDecorationLine: 'underline')
**Why Not Custom**: Would require creating custom underline components with View/Line elements
**Impact**: Custom underlines harder to maintain and position consistently
**Tried**: Font underline only allows on/off, no thickness control

## 💰 **Wallet Compatibility**

- **Phantom Wallet**: Attempted fallback signing approach but still doesn't work properly. Phantom wallet opens but doesn't prompt for transaction signature. Solflare remains the primary supported wallet.
